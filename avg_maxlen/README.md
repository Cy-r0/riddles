# Average length of the longest split in a twig

You have a twig. You split it in 3 parts by cutting it at two random points.

Find the average length of the longest split.


This dir contains two solutions, one in python and one in C.

Compile the C solution with

```
gcc avg_maxlen.c -o avg_maxlen
```

And if you want to time it, pass the script to ```time```.
